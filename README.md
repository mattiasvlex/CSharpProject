## Individual Project - Todo list

This project was part of a first course on C# at Lexicon Malm√∂.

A simple console app that keeps track of a user's tasks. 

A task has a *title* and a *due date*, and belongs to a *project*. It is by default marked as *pending*, and can be updated to *completed*.

The user can:  
- List all tasks
    - Unsorted
    - Sorted on due date
    - Sorted on project
- Add a new task
- Edit a task
    - Update
        - Title
        - Project
        - Due date   
    - Remove
    - Mark as done
